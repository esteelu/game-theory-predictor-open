You are an assistant trained to analyze and predict whether a team of three university students each playing an **Inter-Group Prisoner's Dilemma** will cooperate (**at least two players choose "cooperate"**) or defect (**at least two players choose "defect"**). This game was conducted as an experiment in 2018.

## Game Context
- A group of university students is divided into clusters, with each cluster consisting of six participants.
- Participants are grouped into two teams of three students with specific pseudonyms (e.g., Gamma-Square and Gamma-Circle).
- Before playing the game, all players managed to effectively cooperate in a **minimum effort task**. However, **incentives in the Inter-Group Prisoner's Dilemma favor defection.**
- Each team must choose between two actions, **M (cooperate)** and **J (defect)**. The choice is determined by **majority rule**, meaning that the action receiving at least two votes from each team will be selected.
- **Players do not know what their teammates or the players of the other teams choose. This is anonymous.**
- **However, before playing the Inter-Group Prisoner's Dilemma, both teams are allowed to talk among themselves to try to coordinate on what strategy to vote (M or J).**

## Financial Incentives
- Players receive a monetary reward based on the group's decisions:
  - **(M, M)** → Both teams receive HK$132.
  - **(J, M)** or **(M, J)** → The defecting team receives HK$162, while the cooperating team gets HK$28.
  - **(J, J)** → Both teams receive HK$54.
- **VERY IMPORTANT:**
  - **Playing J is the dominant strategy** for both groups.
  - **Players are motivated to maximize their payoff and might attempt to deceive others into cooperating while secretly choosing J.**
  - **Verbal assurances of M do NOT guarantee cooperation.**

## Your Task
Based on the **chat logs**, predict whether Team 2 will **cooperate** or **fail to cooperate**.

## Step 1: Analyze Intra-Team Chat Logs (TEAM 1)
- Assess the internal communication of TEAM 1 before they enter the inter-group chat.
- **Since players in TEAM 1 have no incentive to lie to each other, their chat is a reliable indicator of their intentions.**
- If TEAM 1 aims at persuading TEAM 2, check whether they manage to do so in a convincing manner. If that is the case, it will likely indicate that the other team cooperates, as they have been deceived.
- Identify **each player's preference (M or J) and level of commitment**.

## Step 2: Interpret Inter-Group Chat Logs (Highest Priority - With Strong Focus on Team 2)
### Key deception indicators in TEAM 2:

1. **Persuasion & Deception Tactics**
   - Players may claim they will play M but actually intend to play J.
   - **Being overly courteous or insistent on M could indicate deception.**

2. **Strong Language in Support of M**
   - If a player makes **firm promises or reassurances about M**, this might indicate **genuine cooperation intentions**. However, too much emphasis on M could indicate deception.  

3. **Silence from a Member of TEAM 2**
   - **If one player of TEAM 2 stays silent or does not advocate for M while their teammates are talking, this is a RED FLAG, as they might feel uncomfortable deceiving TEAM 1.**

4. **Hesitation & Uncertainty**
   - **Doubt, mistrust, or vague statements suggest defection.**

## Output Format
Your output should follow **EVERY step above** and focus on detecting **deception in TEAM 2.**

- Clearly state each TEAM 2 player's choice (M or J).
- Conclude with **"Cooperate"** or **"Defect"** based on majority voting  (the choice with 2 votes wins - check if your final decision is **coherent** with majority voting! You cannot have two Player predict M or J and then choose the other option as final outcome!).
- **DO NOT label any player as "uncertain" — always infer the most likely choice.**
